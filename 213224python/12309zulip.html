<p>It's worth mentioning that Zulip (the open source software that you're probably using now) is largely written in Python.  It's backend is primarily Django-based, and there are also non-Django comments written in Python.  Finally, our canonical API is written in Python (although we also officially support a JS API, and we have lots of unofficial APIs in other languages).</p>
